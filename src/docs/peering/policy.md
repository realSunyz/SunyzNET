# Peering with AS150289

We have an open peering policy, and will peer with other networks following the requirements listed below.

## Technical Requirements

- Peers must operate a publicly routable and visible Autonomous System Number (ASN).
- Peers must have at least one publicly routable /24 of IPv4 and/or one /48 of IPv6 space.
- Peers are required to register their routes in a public Internet Routing Registry (IRR) database, for the purpose of filtering, and to keep this information up to date.
  - We collect data from APNIC, RIPE, ARIN, AFRINIC, LACNIC, and RADb.
  - If you use an IRR database (such as AltDB) that is not listed, contact our NOC, and we will review it. 
- Peers are required to register their routes in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) repository using Route Origin Authorization (ROA) objects.
  - We use Cloudflare's service to validate RPKI information. Any prefixes with invalid status will be dropped.
- Peers must have no adverse record and must not be on our blacklist. The determination is made solely at our discretion.
- Peers are encouraged to implement Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security ([MANRS](https://manrs.org)).

## Operational Requirements

- Peers must maintain an up-to-date PeeringDB entry, including a 24x7 NOC Contact.

## Traffic Requirements

- At this time, there are no minimum traffic requirements for establishing bilateral peering sessions.
